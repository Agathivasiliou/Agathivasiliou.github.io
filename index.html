            <p>I love dance. When i am dancing i feel like i am in another word. I was dancing seens i was 4 years old. I am dancing almost every day. I went in many competitions and in chyprus but aslo yo bulgaria two times one in sofia and one in varna. Dance is my life and i can not live with out it. Dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. I go to fouette ballet school. It is the best ballet school all over the word. We hane three amazing and very talended teacher and i love them all so much they are like my second family. Dances makes me forget all the bad thing that happend. But also dances has and negathive thing. First of all when i hane a competition i dont have free time because i go to school and after to after school clases and after i also have dance and that lives me with know free time. Also i get injuries. One of the main reasons that i get injuries is bacause of pointshoes.
            Eveything that we do in our lifes has negathive and posidive aspects. Nothing has only posidive and nothing has only negathive but we have to do thinks in our lifes that gives us more positive than negathive aspect.

		 		<p>1.This was the competition that i went in 2022 in varna. I went to varna for one week it was a vey amazing but also very difficult because we did not went there to have fun we went there for a competition. This competition was ver competitive because they were so many other dancers that the were very talented. At first went i when there and i saw all the other dancers that the were performing i got so stressed that i could not even breeth. I felt that i froze and i could not move. But after with the help of my teachers i felt so much beter. When it was time to dance and go to the stage i starded again to have stress but when i went to the stage all the stress went away and i was feeling something undescribable. I will never forget this competition it was something special!!!
