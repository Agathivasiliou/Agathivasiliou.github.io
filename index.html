            <p>I love dance. When i am dancing i feel like i am in another word. I was dancing seens i was 4 years old. I am dancing almost every day. I went in many competitions all over the word. Dance is my life and i can not live with out it. Dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.
